# A Moment of Zen
## GA WDI NYC August 2014, Project 1

### Overview 


A Moment of Zen is an aggregator tool for your various social media feeds. It is a dashboard app that allow you to select from a number of social media feeds and display them on your page. It provides you with a moment of zen as you can view all your social media feeds in one page instead of going into each account to check.
