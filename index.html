<p>A Moment of Zen is an aggregator tool for your various social media feeds. It is a dashboard app that allow you to select from a number of social media feeds and display them on your page. It provides you with a moment of zen as you can view all your social media feeds in one page instead of going into each account to check.</p>

<p>A Moment of Zen was developed by Carrie Xu as the first individual project for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. It was developed over a 5 day sprint and will continued to be worked on by the sole developer.</p>
